# File Length and Modularity Rules

> **Mandatory for all AI agents and developers**

## Core Rule: 300 Lines Maximum

Every code file MUST be kept under **300 lines of code**. This is a hard limit, not a suggestion.

### Why This Matters
- **Readability**: Long files are hard to understand and review
- **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to debug and modify
- **Testability**: Modular code is easier to test in isolation
- **Collaboration**: Multiple agents/developers can work on different modules

---

## How to Apply This Rule

### 1. Route Files (`routes/*.ts`)
Keep route handlers thin. If a route file exceeds 300 lines:
- Extract business logic to service files
- Split into route groups (e.g., `routes/ai/index.ts`, `routes/ai/handlers/chat.ts`)

**Good Example:**
```
routes/
├── ai/
│   ├── index.ts           (< 100 lines - route registration)
│   └── handlers/
│       ├── chat.ts        (< 150 lines)
│       ├── conversations.ts (< 100 lines)
│       └── scoring.ts     (< 100 lines)
```

### 2. Service Files (`services/*.ts`)
Services should be focused on a single responsibility:

**Bad:**
```
services/ai-service.ts (800 lines - does everything)
```

**Good:**
```
services/
├── ai/
│   ├── model-config.ts    (model selection logic)
│   ├── streaming.ts       (streaming response handling)
│   ├── context-builder.ts (context preparation)
│   └── chat-service.ts    (main chat orchestration)
```

### 3. Type Definitions
Large type files should be split by domain:
```
types/
├── ai.ts        (AI-related types)
├── trading.ts   (trading types)
├── news.ts      (news/riskflow types)
```

## Enforcement Checklist

Before committing code, verify:

- [ ] No single file exceeds 300 lines
- [ ] Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- [ ] Complex logic is extracted into helper functions or separate modules
- [ ] Related functionality is grouped in directories

---

## Refactoring Triggers

If you find yourself in any of these situations, refactor immediately:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| File approaching 250 lines | Start planning extraction |
| Multiple unrelated functions in one file | Split by responsibility |
| Deeply nested logic | Extract into helper module |
| Copy-pasting code | Create shared utility |

---

## Module Organization Patterns

### Handler Pattern (for routes)
```typescript
// routes/ai/index.ts - Registration only (< 50 lines)
import { chatHandlers } from './handlers/chat.js';
aiRoutes.post('/chat', chatHandlers.handleChat);

// routes/ai/handlers/chat.ts - Logic (< 200 lines)
export async function handleChat(c: Context) { ... }
```

### Service Pattern (for business logic)
```typescript
// services/news-service.ts - Orchestration (< 150 lines)
import { nitterClient } from './nitter-client.js';
import { classifyMacroLevel } from './news-classifier.js';

// services/nitter-client.ts - External API (< 200 lines)
// services/news-classifier.ts - Classification logic (< 100 lines)
```

## Quick Reference

| File Type | Max Lines | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Route index | 50-100 | Route registration |
| Route handler | 150-200 | Request handling |
| Service | 200-300 | Business logic |
| Utility | 50-150 | Helper functions |
| Types | 50-100 | Type definitions |
| Config | 50-100 | Configuration |
